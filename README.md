## AWS BITSian Fingerprint Attendance System + Chatbot

### Purpose
At BITS Pilani, exam attendance is typically recorded manually, even though every classroom is equipped with fingerprint scanners.\n\nThis project leverages that unused infrastructure to automate not just attendance tracking, but also monitor student behavior during exams. For example, it can log when a student leaves the room for a restroom break and when they return, or track how early students are leaving the exam. Such insights allow teachers further insights on their exam quality. \n\nA speaker at a conference I attended highlighted the convenience querying databases using natural language. Inspired by the talk, this project brings that vision to life in a scalable system, and tailored for modern exam monitoring.
